# hello-world

Hi There!

I'm Burak from istanbul, Turkey.

Currently working as a civil engineer and want to change career and become a full-stack web developer as soon as possible. Trying to follow the courses, not really easy when you already have a full-time job which you work 6 days of the week but i try my best.
